### **Design Choices**

#### Fonts

I searched through the google fonts library to find suitable fonts for the title and went for the [Cinzel Decorative](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cinzel+Decorative?preview.text=Everything%27s%20Grand&preview.text_type=custom&preview.size=29#standard-styles) font for the page title as it's easy to read and matches the text in the image.
I paired this font with the [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?preview.text=Everything%27s%20Grand&preview.text_type=custom&preview.size=29&query=lato) font as the two have a similar design that complement each other nicely throughout the page.

## **Wireframes**

I utilised the wireframing tool Balsamic [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) to create my wireframes
I decided to make 4 pages for the different sections of the site with a customised bootstrap navbar at the top of the page
I began with the mobile design as I find it easier to expand from the smaller screen

Below you can see the wireframes of each individual page at the different screen sizes

I found the icon for the company logo that is used on the navbar on Pixabay. I downloaded this one - https://pixabay.com/vectors/cranium-head-abstract-art-thought-3244100/?download

#### Landing Page

#### Hero Image

I decided on a hero image for the top of the site pages and took inspiration from the love running animation of the hero image to create a subtle animateion on the hero image each time the page opens. The hero image is symbolic and represents the goal of the practice which is to lift people up from their problems. The words within the hands are descriptive of the practice and the practitioners.
I used a free image editing tool called Gimp to remove the white background of the hero image so I could clear space for a background video.
Above the image we have the page title which informs the user of which page they are on.
For the background image I went for a bright

### **Design Choices**

#### Fonts

I searched through the google fonts library to find suitable fonts for the title and went for the [Cinzel Decorative](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cinzel+Decorative?preview.text=Everything%27s%20Grand&preview.text_type=custom&preview.size=29#standard-styles) font for the page title as it's easy to read and matches the text in the image.
I paired this font with the [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?preview.text=Everything%27s%20Grand&preview.text_type=custom&preview.size=29&query=lato) font as the two have a similar design that complement each other nicely throughout the page.

#### Icons

#### Colors

Using the [coolers](https://coolors.co/) colour pallette generator I found a colour scheme that I thought would suit the page. I went for contrasting colours of light and dark shades of blue and grey with a hint of bright orange to create an eye catching contrast.
Here is the Pallette I went for - [colour pallette](https://coolors.co/000000-14213d-fca311-e5e5e5-ffffff)

## **Features**

#### Navigation

I created the logo for the page on [logomakr.com](https://logomakr.com)

I used a Bootstrap modal for the enquiry form I used the varying modal content template here as it had the email field and a text area for the users enquiry
Bootstrap Modal - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/modal/ 

#### Landing Page

#### Hero Image

I decided on a hero image for the top of the site pages and took inspiration from the love running animation of the hero image to create a subtle animation on the hero image each time the page opens. The hero image is symbolic and represents the goal of the practice which is to lift people up from their problems. The words within the hands are descriptive of the practice and the practitioners.
I used a free image editing tool called Gimp to remove the white background of the hero image so I could clear space for a background image.
Above the image we have the page title which informs the user of which page they are on.
For the background image I went for a bright mountain top scene. The blue sky with the sun peaking through some hazy clouds

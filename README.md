## **Wireframes**

I utilised the wireframing tool Balsamic [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) to create my wireframes
I decided to make 4 pages for the different sections of the site with a customised bootstrap navbar at the top of the page
I began with the mobile design as I find it easier to expand from the smaller screen

Below you can see the wireframes of each individual page at the different screen sizes

## **Features**

#### Navigation

For the navbar I utilised bootstrap 5 for responsiveness. I used the template with the image and text on this page - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navbar/

I found the icon for the company logo that is used on the navbar on Pixabay. I downloaded this one - https://pixabay.com/vectors/cranium-head-abstract-art-thought-3244100/?download
